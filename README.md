I change the date filter from drop down to date picker filter.

========= Task 1: Create a form and handle submission

Goal:
Create a simple blog posts application where users can create, edit or delete posts. You will practice creating and connecting React components, decomposing the application, using the useState hook.

Instructions

Step 1
Use the create-react-app feature to create a new React application.
Name the project “my-blog-site.”

Step 2
Create a header component. Inside this component, create a navigation bar with “Home,” “Blogs,” and “Contact me” action buttons. Use your own design.

Step 3
Create a footer component, and put your contact information in it. You don’t have to use your real contact info. You can make it up.

Step 4
Create a “BlogPost” component, and render a list of blog posts with title, author, date, and content. Pass these elements of the blog posts as props.

Step 5
Import and display the “BlogPost” component to the main or app component.

Step 6
In the main component, create a form with fields for the title, author, date, and content.

Step 7
Handle the form submission, and use the “useState” hook to add a new post to the list.

======== Task 2: Add Edit and “Delete buttons
Create additional features: “Edit” and “Delete” buttons. Render the “No-content” component when the array containing post data is empty.

Instructions

Step 1
Create a pop-up view of a whole post when the post is clicked.

Step 2
Add the “Edit” button next to each displayed blog post.

Step 3
Create a function to handle the editing of posts.

Step 4
Add the “Delete” button next to each displayed blog post.

Step 5
Create a function to handle the deletion of posts.

Step 6
Render the “No-content” component if the blogs’ array is empty.

Step 7
Use the posting date to add a filtering feature. We need it because blog posts may be too long for one page, and shortening them improves user experience.
